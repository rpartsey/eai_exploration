class IntegratedPointGoalGPSAndCompassSensor(PointGoalSensor):
    r"""Sensor that integrates PointGoals observations (which are used PointGoal Navigation) and GPS+Compass.

    For the agent in simulator the forward direction is along negative-z.
    In polar coordinate format the angle returned is azimuth to the goal.

    Args:
        sim: reference to the simulator for calculating task observations.
        config: config for the PointGoal sensor. Can contain field for
            `goal_format` which can be used to specify the format in which
            the pointgoal is specified. Current options for goal format are
            cartesian and polar.

            Also contains a `dimensionality` field which specifes the number
            of dimensions ued to specify the goal, must be in [2, 3]

    Attributes:
        _goal_format: format for specifying the goal which can be done
            in cartesian or polar coordinates.
        _dimensionality: number of dimensions used to specify the goal
